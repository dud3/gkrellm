<pre>

Changes in 2.2.3 - 2.3.1
------------------------
None

Changes in 2.2.2
----------------
	* Added label_yoff gkrellmrc style variable to control y offset of labels
	  in case there's a need to control that indepedent of top margin.  Not all
	  panels use labels, so this may be of special case usefulness.
	    StylePanel *.label_yoff n
	    StyleMeter *.label_yoff n

	* Added chart_text_no_fill gkrellmrc variable.
	  The default is to fill chart text rectangle extents with the chart
	  background so the text will be more readable on top of data.  Set this
	  to draw chart text without first filling (this will also prevent chart
	  text caching so there will be slightly increased CPU usage.
	    chart_text_no_fill true


Changes in 2.2.1
----------------
None

Changes in 2.2.0
----------------
	* The Pango text drawing now used is slower than GdkFont and to prevent
	  a noticeable overall increase in gkrellm cpu usage, there's a new
	  scroll text decal variation for scrolling text applications where Pango
	  text is drawn onto a pixmap which is then scrolled across the extents
	  of the decal.
	  The limitation here is that this scroll text pixmap must have a
	  background (which is derived from the panel background image) and for
	  all themes, the pixmap background can't exactly blend with the panel
	  background as the decal pixmap is scrolled.

	  For most themes this will be at worst only slightly noticeable, but it
	  might be a problem for some themes with high gradient panel backgrounds.
	  For these problem cases a theme can turn off use of the scrolling pixmap
	  with a new gkrellmrc StyleMeter line.  Some example lines:

	      StyleMeter fs.scroll_text_cache_off = yes
	      StyleMeter gkrellmms.scroll_text_cache_off = yes
	      StyleMeter *.scroll_text_cache_off = yes

	  The builtin monitors which use scroll text decals are: host, fs,
	  mem, and swap.
	  Plugins must be modified to use the scroll text feature, but will
	  probably include plugins like gkrellmms, gkrellmwho2, ...
	  The scroll text cache is automatically turned off for themes having
	  transparent panel backgrounds.
	* Fonts are no longer set from a theme gkrellmrc file and users will
	  config their own font preferences as they would likely have to do anyway
	  since existing gkrellmrc font settings are tailored for GdkFont and
	  don't display well under Pango.


Changes in 2.1.17 - 2.1.28
--------------------------
None

Changes in 2.1.16
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	* Themes can be installed as /usr/share/themes/THEME_NAME/gkrellm2
	  and ~/.themes/THEME_NAME/gkrellm2 as an install convenience if
	  making a gtk2, gkrellm2, ... meta theme.


Changes in 2.1.1 - 2.1.15
-------------------------
None

Changes in 2.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	* bg_chart and bg_panel/bg_meter images can have left and right areas
	  which overlap onto the left and right frames.  This allows the frames
	  to have structures aligned with charts and panels.
	  The frame_{left|right}_panel_overlap values are applied to the bg_panel
	  images of chart monitors, and the bg_meter images of meter monitors.
	  The frame_{left|right}_chart_overlap values are applied to bg_chart
	  images.  Top/bottom borders can be set for the overlap areas.
	  New gkrellmrc settings for these ('x' values are ignored):
	      frame_left_chart_overlap = l
	      frame_right_chart_overlap = r
	      frame_left_panel_overlap = l
	      frame_right_panel_overlap = r
	      frame_left_chart_border = x,x,t,b
	      frame_right_chart_border = x,x,t,b
	      frame_left_panel_border = x,x,t,b
	      frame_right_panel_border = x,x,t,b

	* Spacer images can now be set for all monitors, for chart styled
	  monitors only, or for meter styled monitors only. They may still be
	  set for specific monitors in monitor subdirectories.
	  Spacers may also have left and right overlap areas and left/right
	  borders can be set for them.  The overlapping can be turned off at
	  the monitor level.  The height of the spacers may be set for
	  all monitors, or independently for chart and meter monitor types, or
	  specifically for individual monitors.  A spacer for a specific monitor
	  can be turned off by setting its spacer height to zero. The
	  spacer_{top|bottom}_border values are used for all spacers and can't
	  be set individually.
	  New images:
	      spacer_top.png              # can now be in top level dir
	      spacer_bottom.png
	      spacer_top_chart.png
	      spacer_bottom_chart.png
	      spacer_top_meter.png
	      spacer_bottom_meter.png

	  New gkrellmrc settings for these:
	      frame_left_spacer_overlap = l
	      frame_right_spacer_overlap = r
	      spacer_overlap_off monitor-name
	      spacer_top_height = h
	      spacer_bottom_height = h
	      spacer_top_height_chart = h
	      spacer_bottom_height_chart = h
	      spacer_top_height_meter = h
	      spacer_bottom_height_meter = h
	      spacer_top_height monitor-name h

	      spacer_bottom_height monitor-name h
	      spacer_top_border = l,r,x,x
	      spacer_bottom_border = l,r,x,x

	* Chart top and bottom margins are now used.  If set, margin regions are
	  converted to spacers which excludes them from the active chart drawing
	  area.  This in combination with chart frame overlaps can put bezels
	  around charts.  Set these in the gkrellmrc with:

	      StyleChart *.margins  x,x,t,b

	* New cap images can be drawn on the left and right frames aligned to
	  the top and bottom of each monitor.  Left cap images are left adjusted
	  in the left frame and right cap images are right adjusted in the right
	  frame.  They can be turned off for specific monitors.  Meter monitors
	  can be a single panel so it's probably difficult to design a theme with
	  both top and bottom meter cap images.
	  These images are not scaled and are:
	      cap_top_left_chart.png
	      cap_bottom_left_chart.png
	      cap_top_right_chart.png
	      cap_bottom_right_chart.png
	      cap_top_left_meter.png
	      cap_bottom_left_meter.png
	      cap_top_right_meter.png
	      cap_bottom_right_meter.png

	  New gkrellmrc setting:
	      cap_images_off monitor-name


Changes in 2.0.1 - 2.0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None

Changes for version 2.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* New image decal_button.xpm for general purpose scaled buttons.



Changes in 1.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	* Theme changes for version 2.1.0 are backported to version 1.3.0.

Changes in 1.2.10 - 1.2.13
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None

Changes in 1.2.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Better fine tuning control of object placements in a panel are possible:
  1) "krell_left_margin" and "krell_right_margin" style values can be set
     independently of the panel margins used for decals and labels.
  2) Panel left and right margins can be set to different values with new
     "left_margin" and "right_margin" style values.  Or, set all panel margins
     at once with new "margins" style value.  The old "margin" style value
     still sets left and right margins to the same value.
* A monitor can define custom styles which are themed by adding a custom
  style name field to the StyleMeter and StylePanel lines.  For example, there
  can be things like "StyleMeter monitor.gorn.krell_yoff n" if a monitor
  codes in a custom style "gorn".  When I release GKrellMSS 0.4, look at its
  "Themes" file for a working example of these.
* New set of krell expand modes (left-scaled, right-scaled, and
  bar-mode-scaled) which scales the krell expand to fit between the
  krell left and right margins instead of the full monitor width.
* bar-mode krells use multi frames just like any krell (previously they were
  limited to one frame).

Search in the Themes doc for "1.2.9" for more information.


Changes in 1.2.6 - 1.2.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None

Changes in 1.2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added a "bar-mode" to the previously undocumented set of krell expand
modes.  Krell expands are now documented.

Changes in 1.2.1 - 1.2.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None


Changes in 1.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------
New images:
	bg_separator.png
	decal_alarm.png
	decal_warn.png

	mem/krell_buffers.png
	mem/krell_cache.png

	cpu/nice_data.png
	cpu/nice_data_grid.png

or, instead of the cpu/ images, set in the gkrellmrc:
    set_string cpu_nice_color color_string
    set_string cpu_nice_grid_color color_string

see the Themes doc.

The theme format introduced a year ago in 0.10.0 is now the only format
recognized.  There is no longer backward compatibility with themes based
on the 0.9.x format.


Changes in 1.0.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------
From Anthony Mallet: "XFree > 4.0.2 introduced a new "iso-10646" encoding
which gets selected by default when using *-* for the last two fields of the
font spec, leading to strange glyphs in gkrellm..."

If you have specified fonts in the gkrellmrc this way, you might need
to change the ending of font strings from "...-*-*"  to "...-iso8859-*"

Changes in 1.0.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None

Theme changes in 1.0.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None


Theme changes in 1.0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Timer fixed to use margins, so timer_time_x and timer_button_x in gkrellmrc
  are defunct.  Now all builtins correctly use top_margin and bottom_margin.


Theme changes in 1.0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None


Theme changes in 1.0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are new top_margin and bottom_margin values that can be specified
for panels and they are to replace the overloaded usage of the top
and bottom border values of the background image.  Now you can
(and should) totally decouple margin settings from image border settings.
The previous "margin" value is unchanged and is still used for both
the left and right margins.  So, now there is:

StylePanel *.top_margin = m
StylePanel *.bottom_margin = m
StyleMeter *.top_margin = m
StyleMeter *.bottom_margin = m

and so on.  Count on it taking until GKrellM 1.1.0 is released for all
monitors/plugins to complete the transition to using these new margin
settings.  So, do this:
	a) Upgrade to at least GKrellM 1.0.3 and start using top_margin
	   and bottom_margin for all panels and meters in the gkrellmrc.
    b) If a particular monitor/plugin does not respond to these margin
       settings, it is still using the old top/bottom border settings for
       margins.  So, resort to the old way of adjusting the top/bottom
       border, but be sure you keep a top/bottom margin setting to match
       so things will work the same when the monitor/plugin is fixed.


Theme changes in 1.0.0 - 1.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.2 adds a voltage monitor which can be themed in a "sensors" subdirectory.
It has a custom bg_volt.png image.  Search the Themes doc for bg_volt and run
"gkrellm -demo" to see it if you don't have motherboard sensors.


Theme changes in 0.10.1 - 0.10.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Not much, 0.10.4 fixes a couple of bugs, and 0.10.5 adds set_integer
and set_string options for plugins to the gkrellmrc.


Theme changes in 0.10.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugins are now themeable the same as builtins.  You can put custom bg_panel
images in plugin subdirectories.  See the Themes.html doc.  This has
evolved a new theme format.

The change is not dramatic, just rename monitor specific images into
appropriate subdirectories.

Other new stuff: spacer images, charts and panels can have transparency.


0.10.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Added set_image_border option which gives a way to specify a border for
  an image extension a monitor may add.  The standard backgrounds bg_panel.png
  and bg_chart.png have borders set with Style lines.  But if a monitor adds
  an extension background image (eg. GKrellMMS has an additional background
  bg_scroll.png for its scrolling title panel) it can add a hook so the image
  border can be set (GKrellMMS adds the hook 'gkrellmms_bg_scroll').  So
  if you added the extension image gkrellmms/bg_scroll.png to your theme, you
  could set the border for it with:
      set_image_border  gkrellmms_bg_scroll  l,r,t,b
* Chart, panel, and meter areas can have total or partial transparency.
  Just add lines to the gkrellmrc.  To get total transparency:
	StyleChart  *.transparency 1
  For partial transparency, the root pixmap will show through transparent
  parts of backgrounds if you put in lines like:
	StyleMeter  *.transparency 2
  Since this is not backwards compatible, any theme using this should
  be submitted in the new 0.10.0 format (no few weeks exception - see
  next item).
  Also, any theme which adds plugin theming should not mix formats.  The
  whole thing should be in the new 0.10.0 format.

* Revised theme code to enable plugins to have monitor specific theme
  images and gkrellmrc Style settings just like the builtins.
  So, a new theme organization has evolved, but at least all old themes
  are still handled so there should be a quiet and painless transition
  to the new format over time - nothing like the changes for 0.9.x, I'm
  not doing that again!!
  A few weeks after this release Maher and I will probably start asking
  all themes submitted to the theme site to use the new format, but I
  expect the program will continue to handle 0.9.x formats for a
  reasonably long time.
  It's all pretty simple, monitor specific images are now in subdirectories
  rather than having name qualification.  Just move images to subdirs,
  Eg, a simple 0.9.x theme:
		bg_chart.png
		bg_panel.png
		bg_meter.png
		bg_meter_fs.png
		krell_meter_fs.png
		krell_meter_mem.png
  Becomes in 0.10.0:
		bg_chart.png
		bg_panel.png
		bg_meter.png
		fs/bg_meter.png
		fs/krell.png
		mem/krell.png
  The Themes doc is updated, so take a look.

* New optional monitor specific images: spacer_top.png and spacer_bottom.png
  and spacer_top_height / spacer_bottom_height lines in gkrellmrc.

0.9.8 - 0.9.10
------------------------------
None I can think off.

0.9.7
----------------------
* Theme alternatives are possible.   Put a line in your gkrellmrc:
      theme_alternatives = N
  and then you can have 1 - N different gkrellmrc and image alternatives
  that can be selected in the Themes tab.  For each alternative N,
  you can have an optional gkrellmrc_N whose options will override any
  set in the base level gkrellmrc.  If any image_N.png exists, it will
  be used in place of the base image.png.  This can be used to give
  some flexibility to your theme.  You could have more than one frame
  style or different font colors and sizes.

0.9.0 - 0.9.3
------------------------------
* Run "gkrellm -demo" to force visibility of some less frequently used
  features: cpu temps, apm monitor, demo of slider in meter and panel...
* Image name changes and gkrellmrc changes makes this GKrellM version
  incompatible with themes for previous versions.
* Themes now loaded without restarting.  Apply button applies.
* New images: button_meter_in/out and button_panel_in/out
              bg_slider_panel, bg_slider_meter, krell_slider,
              decal_timer_button
* Obsolete images: bg_bordered, bg_spacer, ppp_button, frame_side, and
  frame_horizontal.
* Keyboard shortcut aids:
	F5  Reload current theme
	F6  Toggle theme image loading debugging
	f7  Toggle theme gkrellmrc parsing debugging
# margin Style option for left/right justified labels and decals.  These
  positions are now decoupled from left/right borders.  Labels are still
  placed vertically within top/bottom borders.


0.8.0	Fri Jan 14, 2000
----------------------------------------
* Theme directory is changed from ~/.gkrellm to ~/.gkrellm/themes
* Use of images frame_horizontal.xxx and frame_side.xxx are deprecated.
  New themes should not use them and old themes should be converted.  I
  would like for them to go away.
* In the gkrellmrc:
  -> Frame_side_border is replaced with frame_left_border and
     frame_right_border.  Frame_width is replaced with frame_left_width
     and frame_right_width.
  -> New options frame_top_height and frame_bottom_height to allow rendering
     to dimensions different from the drawn frame_top/bottom images.
  -> label, meter, time, alt1, alt2 text can have a shadow color specified.
  -> Colors for individual panel labels can be specified with style lines to
     override the general colors.
* Frame images can have transparency.
* Additional background panel images: bg_meter_uptime, bg_meter_cal,
  bg_meter_clock, bg_meter_host.
* As originally intended, decals (net LEDs) can now really overlap.
------
Some ideas now possible:
1) Make a custom bg_meter_host to integrate with  a transparent frame_top
   for a more impressive top frame.  Likewise with bg_meter_uptime
   and frame_bottom.
2) You can create a single combined clock/calendar background by making
   the larger image and then splitting it into bg_meter_clock and
   bg_meter_cal.  This could also be done with bg_meter_mem / bg_meter_swap.
3) Set a panel label_shadow_color bright and label_color dim to get
   an etched in look for the label.
4) Overlap net LEDs in various ways:  concentric circles, tri-color LED,
   some kind of intertwined pattern.

0.7.4
------------------------------
* Added frame_side_border to gkrellmrc.

0.7.1 - 0.7.3
------------------------------
* None

0.7.0
----------------------
* New gkrellmrc author line so theme authors can be credited in the Themes
  configuration tab.  Just add a line to your gkrellmrc like:
    author = "yourname  email address"

* Added optional images data_in.xxx, data_in_etch.xxx, data_out.xxx,
  and data_out_etch.xxx.  If these images exist in the theme directory
  they will be used to plot data.  Otherwise use the colors specified in
  gkrellmrc.  Textured or 3D plotted data to go with your bg_chart.xxx
  is now possible (but is not noticeable with sparse data).

0.6.8
----------------------
* I should have made a notice of this for release 0.6.7, but
  Maher Awamy has put up a GKrellM theme site at www.muhri.net.
  Check it out, there are some nice themes showing up.
* String values in gkrellmrc can have quotes around them.  So, font names
  can have spaces.
* New options in gkrellmrc: chart_width_ref, allow_scaling.
* Monitor label midpoint positions can now be specified as a percent
  of chart_width.

The above allows label positions to be offset to the left (right) of
center to make room to put both LED's to the right (left) of the label.
And the LED's size and position can be scaled as chart sizes are changed.

0.6.5
----------------------
* Added a large font for the clock/calendar digits.  It uses time_color.

0.6.1
----------------------
* I have warned that chart_labels.xxx is subject to change.  It has been
  done.  It no longer exists (likewise with meter_labels and digits).
  I draw with X fonts so you can specify fonts and label colors now.
* Two new optional images: frame_left.xxx and frame_right.xxx
* The gkrellmrc file is no longer overloaded to handle user preferences
  and theme settings.  Now user prefs are done in a gui popup and the
  gkrellmrc file is only for theme stuff.  For this reason, the
  ~/.gkrellm/gkrellmrc file is no longer read.  A gkrellmrc file is read
  only from theme directories specified in gkrellm_theme.cfg or on the
  command line.
* Some new settings in the gkrellmrc template.
