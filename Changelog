2.2.10 - Thu Oct 26, 2006
-------------------------
	* Hans de Goede patches: 1) handle sysfs sensors which represent themselves
	  as platform drivers (/sys/class/hwmon). 2) Add a libsensors sensor
	  monitor interface which will be used preferentially over sysfs if
	  libsensors is installed and sensors_init() on /etc/sensors.conf succeeds.
	* Add --without-libsensors command line option to force using /sysfs
	  instead of libsensors for cases when running a new Linux sensor kernel
	  module that is not yet supported by libsensors.  A fallback to /sysfs is
	  automatic when libsensors detects zero sensors.
	* Linux sensor config names change with migration to libsensors, so attempt
	  to automatically do a conversion so user won't have to redo sensor
	  config.  But this doesn't handle client/server runs so for these
	  sensor configs must be redone.
	* Michael Buesch patch: Add PowerMac G5 Windfarm sensor monitor interface.
	* David G. North patch: Add content length check to mbox mail checking to
	  get good mail counts even if there's a mal-formed mime content package.

	  o gkrellmd plugins didn't get initial update data.
	  o Don't limit mbmon detection to i386 architectures.
	  o Flush gtk events pending between closing and moving gkrellm so
	    window managers can get width updates before the move.
	  o Fix warnings from newer gcc.

	  slabs from the used memory and add it to the cached value instead.
	* Put multiple instances lock files in /var/lock.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Fix gkrellm_125_sequence() off by a bit here and there.
	  o Invalidate chart text runs when chart height changed.
	  o mbmon sensors decimal point char can be different from current locale.
	  o Read linux cpu stats from /proc/stat as 64 bits.
	  o Segfault on editing disk chart format string after disabling a disk.
	  o gkrellmd -plog segfaulted if no plugins are installed.
	  o Don't NULL serve_name prior to each gkrellmd plugin serve_data call.
	  o Use a per client input_func in gkrellmd_client_read().

	* UI improvement in fs.c and mail.c config button sensitivities and labels.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Test for not force creating user mailbox did not consider a configured
	    mail fetch.

	    and server/mail.c mailbox code needed syncing with src/mail.c.
	  o gkrellmd glib 1.2 g_file_test compatibility was broken.
	  o gkrellmd debug-level option was missing.
	  o Darwin Makefile: add HAVE_GETADDRINFO=1

	    _NET_WM_STRUT size so strut space can be resized when shutting gkrellm.
	  o Don't save new y_positions that are y packed and not user set (eg
	    preserve user positon when opening fs secondaries for > 10 seconds).
	  o Don't nest static function declarations inside of functions to fix

2.2.0 - Sat May 15, 2004
------------------------
	* Replace GdkFont text drawing with Pango.
	* Add plugin capability to the gkrellmd server. Wrote demo5 plugin as a
	  tutorial on a client/server capable plugin.
	* Minimize Pango drawing to get CPU usage down:
	  1) Draw chart text on a caching text layer.
	  2) Add a "scroll text" api to text decals where a Pango string is
	     drawn on a pixmap which can be srolled by setting the decal offset.
	  See the plugins and themes changelog for more info.
	* linux.c reads temperatures from the hddtemp daemon so disk temperature
	  display can be consistent with other sensors (and detected by gkrellmd).
	* Hajimu Umemoto: glib12 server Makefile, use `glib-config --libs glib
	  gmodule and initialize text extent in clock.c

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.1.28 - Fri Mar 5, 2004
-------------------------
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Stephan Kapfinger <s.kapfinger--at--gmx.de> mail.c patch fixes bug
	      I introduced into the last release where parsing of mail launch
	      commands could fail.

2.1.27 - Sat Feb 28, 2004
-------------------------
	* Handle changing sysfs sensor name format from xxx_inputN to xxxN_input.
	* Patches:
	  o Kurt V. Hindenburg <khindenburg--at--cherrynebula.net> Consider only
	    .so, .la, and .dll files during plugin scan (avoid Gentoo .keep
	    ebuild files).
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Use g_spawn_async_with_pipes() instead of popen() in mail.c so gkrellm
	    file descriptors won't be open in the mail monitor launched MUA.

2.1.26 - Mon Feb 23, 2004
-------------------------
	* Patches:
	  o Frederick Bruckman <fredb--at--immanent.net> detect multiple CPUs
	    on NetBSD.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Andreas Liebe <liebe--at--hrz.tu-darmstadt.de> patch to solaris.c
	    prevents running out of fds on some SPARC servers.
	  o CPU and Net stats from 64 bit gkrellmd server overflowed on a 32
	    bit client.
	  o Changed Linux sysfs sensor temperature factor from 100 to 1000.
	    Those running Linux kernels >= 2.6.2 should now only need gkrellm
	    config temperature factors of 1.0.  But those still running kernels
	    <= 2.6.1 may still need factor of 10 gkrellm config adjustments.
	  o $d should be %d typo in cs.po


2.1.25 - Tue Jan 20, 2004
-------------------------
	* Hajimu UMEMOTO upgrades to the mail monitor:
	  o Added a STARTTLS option for SSL mail checking.
	  o Added NTLM authentication options for IMAP and POP3 and the required
	    SMP crypto functions in files ntlm.h and smb*.[ch] (these functions
	    are from fetchmail-6.2.5).
	  o Organized a separate protocol and authentication mechanism structure
	    to facilitate adding future authentication types.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o lock out using initial bogus window positions from configure event to
	    avoid startup position errors.
	  o Matti Rendahl <matti--at--comedialabs.com> patch fixes uninitialized
	    MemShared variable which doesn't exist in Linux 2.6 /proc/meminfo.
	  o FS displayed "used" blocks/percentage should be function of b_free and
	    not b_avail to be consistent with df command.  Change arg types of
	    gkrellm_fs_assign_fsusage_data() from gulong to glong as is in statfs()
	    so can display negative BSD b_avail values (like the BSD df command).
	  o Linux ACPI battery got confused on spurious kernel buggy remaining
	    capacity readings that were greater than full capacity.
	  o In client mode check for sysname changes at server reconnects in case
	    server was rebooted with different kernel.
	* Translation updates
	  o ja.po from Takeshi AIHANA <aihana--at--jcom.home.ne.jp>

	  o Hajimu UMEMOTO & Peter Hessler worked out OpenBSD md5.h compile issue.
	  o Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@air.luon.net> detect Linux sysfs lm75
	    temperature files that don't end in a digit.
	* Translation updates
	  o de.po

2.1.23 - Wed Dec 17, 2003
-------------------------
	* Hajimu UMEMOTO patch fixes mail check SSL implementation issues.  Now
	  SSL is a connection protocol which can be selected for all remote mail
	  authorization types so there can be IMAP over SSL, POP3 over SSL, etc.
	  Also fixes broken md5 compiles and missing -l crypto.
	* Patches:
	  o Peter Hessler <phessler--at--theapt.org> some OpenBSD compile fixes

-------------------------
	* Look for themes: /usr/share/themes/{THEME_NAME}/gkrellm2 and
	  ~/.themes/{THEME_NAME}/gkrellm2.  Make gtk2 theme tracking work with
	  a default theme fallback when a gtk2 matching gkrellm theme is not found.
	* Add disks from the config only if enabled so stale disks (from hardware
	  or partition changes) won't persist in the config.
	* Added plugin API to the alerts amd removed gvoice plugin specific code
	  from alerts.c (a gkrellm2 port of it can use this new API).

-------------------------
	* Avoid some config breakage should the locale change:
	  o Don't write translated "Disk" into the config.
	  o Scale config saving/loading of floats to avoid writing decimal points.
	  After initializing from user_config and sensors_config, start using
	  new config file names user-config and sensor-config since the config is
	  now not backwards compatible.
	* Get disk data from /proc/diskstats on kernels >= 2.6.0

	    fs types to ignore.
	  o Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> gkrellmd workaround for listen()
	    returning EADDRINUSE problem on some machines that are both IPv6 and
	    IPv4 enabled.

2.1.12 Mon Jun 2, 2003
----------------------
	* The 2.1.12a tarball has no code changes, only a patch from

	  a gkrellmd pidfile fails.
	* Two display modes (selected with a panel button) for system name when it
	  doesn't fit: 1) shortened name 2) vertical scroll of kernel name/version.
	* Edge resistance to make it easy to move gkrellm to screen edges.

	  This is oonfigured in gkrellmd and not on the gkrellm client side.
	* Preserve '~' when entered in a local mailbox config.
	* Allow simple x.y.z.* as a subnet pattern for gkrellmd allow-host option.
	* Periodic saving of net data.
	* Some new plugin functions - see plugins changelog.
	* Patches:
	  o Tilman Sauerbeck <tilman--at--code-monkey.de> Makefile generates and
	    installs a gkrellm.pc file so plugins can use `pkg-config gkrellm`.
	  o Vincent Bernat <bernat--at--free.fr> set SO_REUSEADDR on gkrellmd
	    sockets so gkrellmd can be restarted without delays.
	  o Kacper Kornet <kornet--at--camk.edu.pl> make gkrellmd disable reading
	    nfs file system data if nfs-interval is set to zero.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Scale borders of theme images instead of zeroing them if border extents
	    are greater than image dimensions (avoids breaking some themes).
	  o gkrellmd nfs file system stats weren't always served.
	  o Re-render nice data pixmap at cpu chart height changes.
	  o Draw memory krells in the right order so themes can have an xosview
	    style multi-colored bar for memory usage.

2.1.10 Sat Apr 26, 2003
-----------------------
	* Added INSTALLROOT to Makefile, see INSTALL file.
	* Punt on _NET_WM_STATE and send the messages on the map event, so

	    kernel's new /proc/stat field 'iowait' in CPU time calculation.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Set WM_CLASS of all dialogs.
	  o Make gkrellmd pidfile after detaching.

2.1.9 Sat Apr 5, 2003

	  "Auto mode sticks at peak value" is set.  See the README for updated
	  description of chart auto combinations.
	* Added $cN and $CN variables to inet chart format strings for total
	  connections over last N minutes (N <= chart width).
	* Net transfer stats kept for current day, week, and month.  Displayable on
	  charts using substitution vars; or chart button summarizes in a pop up.
	  If there's a timed net, connect times also displayed in its pop up.
	* gkrellmd server disconnect alert has a user config for an alarm command.
	* gkrellmd --pidfile option.
	* gkrellmd serves data for multiple batteries.
	* hide battery panels if batteries not present.
	* Don't gkrellm lock if lockf() fails for errors other than EAGAIN.
	  Option --nolock is another way to disable locking.
	* Patches:
	  o Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> devstat api fix for latest
	    FreeBSD 5-CURRENT.
	  o Tilman Sauerbeck <tilman--at--code-monkey.de> two new gkrellm piximage

	* Bugfixes:
	  o Overflow fix when computing chart y coords for large data values.
	  o Serve gkrellmd fs data to _all_ clients.
	  o de-transpose int/pointer type args to gtk_tree_store_new() in gui.c.
	    (caused config segfaults where sizeof(int) < sizeof(pointer))
	  o Make all config windows set WM_CLASS to Gkrellm_conf.
	  o Yuri Arapov <yuri.arapov--at--sctest.vrn.ru> added missing fclose()

2.1.8 Wed Mar 12, 2003
----------------------
	* Added many alerts:  cpu, load, disk, net, file system, memory, and swap.
	  Some of these can have the alert trigger delayed for an interval during
	  which triggering conditions must exist.
	* Added some new alert functions - see the plugins changelog.
	* New gkrellmd.conf options:
	  o io-timeout and reconnect-timeout for automatic gkrellm reconnections
	    to gkrellmd servers. See gkrellmd.conf or "man gkrellmd".
	  o inet-interval so Linux reads of /proc/net/tcp can be slowed down.
	    For Linux SMP machines which have a strange feature where a single read
	    of /proc/net/tcp can for example take 0.7 seconds.
	* Made allow multiple instances configurable in the GUI.  And added a
	  Display name component to the lock file when no multiple instances.
	* Warn if incompatible -w flag and window dock type option is set.
	* Fix battery acpi to handle some variations: files named "status" instead
	  of "state", and capitalized field descriptions.
	* Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> patch handles some definitions
	  which were moved from dkstat.h to resource.h under FreeBSD 5-CURRENT.
	* Ben Hines <bhines--at--alumni.ucsd.edu> Darwin Makefile link flag
	  changes adds bind_at_load and prebind for faster launching.

	  o sv.po from Christian Rose <menthos--at--menthos.com>
	* Bugfixes
	  o Christopher Hassell <jeezfrk--at--pobox.com> patch stops some segfaults
	    by making disk_assign_data() really not reference NULL disks.
	  o Brian Almeida <bma--at--tux.org> fix to check chart format strings
	    for NULL to stop some segfaults (it happens when g_locale_from_utf8()
	    cannot convert a utf8 string to the current locale so this may also
	    be a user font problem).
	  o Patrik Modesto <mody--at--atlas.cz> patch changes fopen() to open()
	    in Linux gkrellm_sys_net_isdn_online().  Beats me why fopen()
	    wasn't working.

2.1.7a Wed Jan 29, 2003
-----------------------
No code changes in gkrellm proper, but I'm putting up this "a" version because
I got a very needed translation update just after releasing 2.1.7:
	* Takeshi AIHANA <aihana--at--jcom.home.ne.jp> ja.po update.
	* Oh, and there's Hajimu UMEMOTO's small one liner gkrellmd change to make
	  the new gkrellmd drop privileges options work in *BSD.

	* Bugfixes
	  o The name conversion for scsi disk major(8) added in 2.1.6 segfaulted
	    for drives > sda.  So removed the patch and fixed the name conversion
	    in the right place, the disk_name_map[].
	  o Prevent sensor relocation to Proc or CPU panels when those monitors are
	    not enabled.
	  o Bill Nalen fixed a couple of potential Windows memory leaks.

2.1.6 Wed Jan 22, 2003
----------------------
	* Net charts appear in sorted order (excepting one linked to the timer).
	* Let Linux ACPI battery monitoring work even if no ac_adapter file.
	* Patches:
	  o Andreas Boman <aboman--at--eiwaz.com> had two Linux patches:
	    - added name conversion from scsi disk major(8) and minor numbers for
	      devfs systems.
	    - implemented reading disk stats from sysfs for recent 2.5.x kernels.
	  o Based on patch by Daniel Gardell <f00daga--at--dd.chalmers.se> make
	    linux.c acpi_setup() use a dirent scan instead of hardwired battery and
	    ac_adapter names.

	    decimal point mismatch between client and server.
	  o Inet monitor connections needed to be reset when reconnecting to the
	    gkrellmd server.
	  o Don't use getifaddrs() for net stats on Darwin.

2.1.5 Wed Jan 8, 2003
---------------------
	* Added a file lock to help avoid the multiple gkrellm launches by buggy
	  session managers problem.
	* Linux disk chart names are ordered when stats are from /proc/partitions.
	* Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> BSD changes:
	  o Based on a patch from Christian	Weisgerber <naddy--at--freebsd.org>,
	    use getifaddrs(3) to gather information for a network meter where it
	    is available to avoid if_msghdr alignment problem under OpenBSD/alpha.
	  o For sensor compiles, use changed smd.h location in FreeBSD 5-CURRENT.

	  Added system tray icon for server version of GKrellM.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Solaris fixes: gkrellmd compiles when making in the server dir, and
	    memory/swap monitors did not work because Solaris printf formatting
	    doesn't grok %L.
	  o Bad Linux disk monitoring when /proc/partitions had expanded names
	    such as ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 instead of simple hda1.
	* Translation updates
	  o de.po translation update.
	  o Jerome UZEL <jerome.uzel--at--wanadoo.fr> fr.po update.
	  o Grigory Batalov <bga--at--altlinux.ru> ru.po update.
	  o Przemyslaw Sulek <pbs--at--linux.net.pl> pl.po update.

2.1.3 Fri Dec 6, 2002
---------------------
	* If disk stats from /proc/partitions are available, the Linux disk monitor
	  reports data from all disks and individual partitions listed there.  It
	  takes a recent kernel compiled with .config option CONFIG_BLK_STATS=y.
	* Battery monitor can display multiple batteries.
	* Cleaned up some theme scaling rough edges:  Margins are scaled.  Panel
	  background borders are scaled.  Krell yoff values from gkrellmrc are
	  scaled (yoff values set programatically are not).
	* Bill Nalen <nalenb--at--towers.com> Windows changes:
	  Changed system tray icon response for left mouse button.

	  o pl.po from Przemyslaw Sulek <pbs--at--linux.net.pl>

2.1.1 Sun Nov 24, 2002
----------------------
	* User can set a theme scale for adjusting krell and decal sizes.  Do this
	  with custom font settings if you have high resolution screen squint eye.
	  Some plugins will need small code updates before their decals can scale.
	* Ben Hines <bhines--at--alumni.ucsd.edu> Darwin compile fixes.
	* Eric Lauriault <elauri--at--lacitec.on.ca> Solaris 8 compile fixes.
	* Bill Nalen <nalenb--at--towers.com> Windows changes: multi cpu reporting
	  and mail check sockets being left open bug fixes; enable_nls translations
	  now work; added Windows sysdep code debugging output.
	* Various small bugfixes: right pixel truncation of shadow text; cpu chart
	  autoscaling past 100%; memory leak when loading a theme alternative > 0;
	  wrong gdk atom function was used in net_wm_state().
	* Renamed apm.c to battery.c and replaced "apm" with "battery" in function
	  names and the sysdep interface.
	  Made Battery monitor work better if battery removed while running.
	* Patches:
	  o Tom Prado <tprado--at--charter.net> added Linux ACPI battery support
	    and changed "APM" config references to "Battery".

----------------------
	* New theming features.  Left and right areas of chart, panel and spacer
	  images can overlap onto the left and right frames.  If chart top/bottom
	  margins are set, the margin areas are converted to spacers.  These allow
	  themes to have frame image structure which aligns with charts and panels.
	  Themes can have "cap" images which are drawn on left and right frames
	  aligned with monitor top and bottom positions.
	  See themes changelog and the themes doc for more info.
	  Bumped minor version to 1 because themes can now be made which won't work
	  with previous versions.
	* Added EWMH options: skip taskbar, skip pager, and floating.  Floating
	  is a recent EWMH addition.
	* gkrellmd can detach from its controlling terminal with -d option.
	* Bill Nalen <nalenb--at--towers.com> Windows updates:
	  o Changed sensors list to be fixed instead of read from MBM to fix
	    issue of GKrellM being loaded before MBM.
	  o Put icon in systray and removed from task bar.
	  o Added files resource.c, resource.rc, and gkrellm.ico.
	  o Updated GTK library which fixed crashes under certain shells.
	  o Allow loading to slit under Bluebox (bluebox.lokai.net) with -w option.
	* Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> FreeBSD updates:
	  o If ACPI is available, temperature and battery information are obtained
	    via ACPI in the APM monitor.
	  o Some sysctl() usage is cleaned up.
	* Patches:
	  o Hajimu UMEMOTO added use of daemon() function for gkrellmd terminal
	    detach in BSD.
	  o Bill Nalen gkrellmd socksetup() fix when HAVE_GETADDRINFO is
	    not defined.

2.0.4 Mon Sep 23, 2002
----------------------
	* Patches
	  o Peter Hessler <phessler--at--sfobug.org> OpenBSD Makefile changes.
	* Bugfixes
	  o gkrellmd had a nice big memory leak.
	* Translation updates
	  es.po from Cristian Othon Martinez Vera <cfuga--at--itam.mx>

2.0.3 Thu Sep 19, 2002
----------------------
	* Rewrote sensors config to use gtk tree store/view.  Got rid of the ugly
	  magic labels and un exported gkrellm_sensor functions which depended on
	  those magic labels (no plugins I know of used them).  If you had temps
	  or fans located on the Proc or CPU panel via magic labels, you'll need
	  to relocate them.  Temps, fans, and voltages can be re-ordered by a
	  drag 'n drop in the config.
	* Doing the sensors config was such a blast that I kept on and converted
	  configs for all builtin monitors to use an instant apply.  It makes
	  things like editing chart label format strings much nicer.
	* If client mode loses server connection, click on alarm for reconnect try.
	* gkrellmd --allow-hosts recognizes keyword ALL, new option --clear-hosts.
	* Based on a Solaris patch from David Bustos <bustos--at--caltech.edu>
	  which adds gkrellm_cpu_add_instance() to the sysdep interface, now cpu
	  numbers match possibly non-sequential OS cpu instance numbers.  The patch
	  fixes the Solaris compile by adding -lresolv for linking to inet_aton().
	* Bugfixes
	  o Second try at really fixing Gtk2 theme switch frame transparency bug.
	* Translation updates
	  o de.po translation update.
	  o fr.po from Jerome UZEL <jerome.uzel--at--wanadoo.fr>
	  o pl.po from Przemyslaw Sulek <pbs--at--linux.net.pl>
	  o sl.po from Simon Cahuk <simon.cahuk--at--uni-mb.si>
	  o sv.po from Christian Rose <menthos--at--menthos.com>

2.0.2 Wed Sep 6, 2002
---------------------
	* Bufixes
	  o Linux sensors stopped working for locales where the decimal
	    point is not a period.
	  o Side frames lost transparency when a Gtk2 theme was changed.

2.0.1 Wed Sep 4, 2002
---------------------
	* Patches
	  o Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> nice patch to add IPv6 support
	    for client/server connections and passing of inet data.  Added
	    is_valid_reverse() and socksetup() functions to server/main.c.  Now
	    allow_host() checks if reverse lookup is registered in forward lookup.
	    He also patched apm.c so battery percent display switches automatically
	    for laptops which return battery time left only when AC line status is
		off-line.
	  o Vladimir Kondratiev <vladimir.kondratiev--at--intel.com> gkrellm.spec
	    fix to use gkrellm2 include dir and to package server files.
	  o win32 files update from Bill Nalen.
	* Translation updates
	  o sl.po from Simon Cahuk <simon.cahuk--at--uni-mb.si>
	* Bugfixes
	  o net command launching config changes were not saved.
	  o make PACKAGE=xxx consistency fixes.
	  o Linux sensors should now read odd sensor file formats such as fscpos.

2.0.0 Tues Aug 13, 2002
-----------------------
	* Final bugfixes and cleanups.
	* See 2.0 porting guide for plugin development related release notes.
	* Added a client mode visual alert if server connection is broken.

2.0.0-pre3 Fri Aug 9, 2002
--------------------------
	* Added utf8 <-> current locale fixes so config text from user_config
	  will be utf8 and strings written with gdk_draw calls will be in the
	  current locale.

2.0.0-pre2 Tue Aug 6, 2002
--------------------------
	* gkrellm_message_window() and gkrellm_config_message_window() replaced
	  with gkrellm_message_dialog() and gkrellm_config_message_dialog().
	* Make can set PACKAGE=name for text domain other than gkrellm,
	  for example: make PACKAGE=gkrellm2
	* Bugfixes:
	  o gkrellm_message_window() was blocking.
	  o Changed internet host addresses from the server to use dot notation.
	  o Disabled bad IPv6 server->client handling.
	  o Initial inet data from server was omitting already alive connections.
	  o Usage and debug message output needed conversion to locale from utf8.
	* Translation updates
	  es.po from Cristian Othon Martinez Vera <cfuga--at--itam.mx>

2.0.0-pre1.3 Fri Aug 2, 2002
----------------------------
	* One change to help with translation frustrations.  Added Jerome UZEL's
	  bind_textdomain_codeset(PACKAGE, UTF-8) suggestion so translations
	  do not need to be in UTF-8.

2.0.0-pre1.2 Thu Aug 1, 2002
----------------------------
	* David Bustos <bustos--at--caltech.edu> patched solaris.c so Solaris version
	  will compile.  Also changes in server directory so gkrellmd will compile
	  under Solaris.
	* Translation uprades to 2.0.0 strings and utf-8:
	  o fr.po from Jerome UZEL <jerome.uzel--at--wanadoo.fr>

2.0.0-pre1.1 Wed Jul 31, 2002
-----------------------------
	* Nothing here of general interest except for those that want one of the
	  below translations.  Otherwise, this version is a sysdeps setup
	  affecting Darwin, BSD and libgtop compiles.
	* Initialized sysdeps/darwin.c
	* Fixed sysdeps/gtop.c so gtop version can compile.
	* Makefile updates and no more Makefile links.
	* Translation uprades to 2.0.0 strings and utf-8:
	  o pl.po from Przemyslaw Sulek <pbs--at--linux.net.pl>
	  o sl.po from Simon Cahuk <simon.cahuk--at--uni-mb.si>
	  o sv.po from Christian Rose <menthos--at--menthos.com>
	  o es.po from Cristian Othon Martinez Vera <cfuga--at--itam.mx>

2.0.0-pre1 Mon Jul 29, 2002
---------------------------
	* Disk monitor data will be in bytes if supported by sysdep interface.
	* Various small bugfixes and cleanups: parts of gkrellmrc config parsing
	  were failing; better force net config handling from client-server
	  interface; fs drawer button behaviour modified; put back in --wm command
	  line switch; utf8 validate text buffer strings; check for badly set
	  theme image borders;
	* Some OpenBSD sysdep touch ups based on a sent in compile log.

2.0.0-pre0.x
------------
	* pre0.14:
	  o Bill Nalen Windows updates:
	    * Updated win32 files for Windows client/server version
	    * Fixed some bugs in client.c and monitor.c
	    * allow more than 1 cpu for NT/2k/XP - need new perfkey.dat

	* pre0.13:
	  o Can now run gkrellm in client mode which will connect to a gkrellmd
	    server.  Added server directory which implements a gkrellmd server
	    that reuses the gkrellm sysdep code so servers should be automatically
	    available for architectures gkrellm is ported to.
	    gkrellm has new options --server and ---port.
	    This is brand new and I would welcome some testing feedback!
	  o Added session management.
	  o Added more major device entries to disk name table.
	  o Spaces now allowed in sensors labeling.  Sensor config compatibility
	    with pre0.12 is gone, so users must reconfig sensors.  This also
	    should fix temp/fan config saving problem on Windows.
	  o Bugfixes: Some configs wouldn't save in pre0.12.
	  o Simon Cahuk <simon.cahuk--at--uni-mb.si> new sl.po translation.
	  o Code contribs/Patches:

	      interval patch.

	* pre0.12:
	  o Cleaned out all deprecated Gtk/Gdk/glib functions except for Gdk
	    font/string handling which will be on hold until I know if Gtk 2.2 will
	    have Pango equivalents for them.  clist and ctree are replaced
	    with tree store and list store code.
	  o Create builtin/plugin configs on demand.
	  o Changed keyboard shortcuts for theme changing to Page_Up/Page_Down.
	  o Use data-suffix directories when running gkrellm -c or when in
	    force-host-config mode.
	  o Enforce no popup messages during gkrellm_init_plugin().
	  o Bill Nalen updated win32.c to run with mbm 5.1.9+
	  o Patches:

	      window hints for sticky state and dock type (on-top/skip tasklist).

	* pre0.11:
	  o Use GTK_STOCK icon buttons.
	  o Bill Nalen win32.c update, fixed # processes for win9x
	  o Nick Mitchell <firepile--at--speakeasy.net> patch: fix IMAP login fail
	    if password had certain chars.
	  o Fix Linux APM to use ac_online status when battery status is unknown.

	* pre0.10:
	  o 0.10a Added parameter to gkrellm_style_is_themed() so in addition to
	    checking if any style setting was themed, can check specific settings.
	  o Improved button handling so buttons are no longer required to be
	    created after the panel is created.
	  o Improved theme style setting capability for krells.
	  o Updated the plugin programmers reference and demo plugis to this
	    2.0.0 version.
	  o Bill Nalen updated win32 files and added perfkey.dat file.

	  o win32.c, win32-plugin.h, win32-plugin.c updates from Bill Nalen.
	* pre0.8:
	  o Couple of small changes: handle spaces in mailbox names, try to load
	    pango font descriptions from font browser first.
	  o Bill Nalen added topmost window option for Windows.
	* pre0.7:
	  o Show/hide secondary fs monitors with mouse wheel.
	  o Removed gkrellm_remove_and_destroy_decal (and krell) and fixed
	    gkrellm_destroy_decal (and krell) to check if remove needed.
	  o Alternate font loading handles Pango font descriptions from the dialog.
	* pre0.6:
	  o Touched up default gkrellmms theme.
	  o Real CPU charts for SMP machines did not work.

	  o Made gkrellm2 the directory for plugins, themes, and user config.

	* Bill Nalen <bill--at--nalens.com> contributed Windows code.
	* Ported GKrellM to run under Gtk+-2.0.  It uses gdk-pixbuf and no longer
	  uses Imlib.  See the porting guide for more details on changes.

---------------------
	* Bugfixes
	  o Bad handling of pclose() error returns in mail.c could cause segfaults.
	* Contributions:
	  o Przemyslaw Sulek <pbs--at--linux.net.pl> pl.po translation update.

1.2.7 Wed Jan 2, 2002
---------------------
	* Don't read all the gkrellmrc files at startup, just display author for
	  the current theme.
	* Improved mail config for cleaner handling of non-standard port numbers
	  and the authentication support Hajimu has added.  Substituted in public
	  domain md5c.c and md5.h.

	  o Session management args could have NULL pointer.
	  o Hajimu UMEMOTO patch to fix a duplicate free in net.c

1.2.5 Wed Dec 5, 2001
----------------------
	* Changed positioning behaviour:  when vertical size decrease moves gkrellm
	  off bottom of screen, bias y position towards the last user set position.
	* Under systems that support ejecting, more ejectable device control added
	  to file system monitor.  If a device is set "Ejectable" in the config,
	  there will be an eject button which uses an internal ioctl CDROM eject
	  or an eject command (if installed) for additional devices.  Linux uses
	  the "eject" command while FreeBSD and NetBSD use the "cdcontrol" command.
	  Ejecting patches for FreeBSD from Hajimu, NetBSD from Anthony, and
	  Solaris from Daisuke.
	* Option to run sensor reads in a thread - for systems with slow sensor
	  interfaces that cause display pauses.

	  by Martin Man <Martin.Man--at--seznam.cz>)
	* Bugfixes:
	  o gkrellm -demo segfaulted.
	  o CPU sensor decals could be mapped wrong.
	* Contributions:
	  o Anthony Mallet <anthony.mallet--at--useless-ficus.net> sensors.c patch
	    adds temp, fan, and voltage monitoring for NetBSD
	  o Przemyslaw Sulek <pbs--at--linux.net.pl> pl.po translation update.
	  o Darell Tan <dardil--at--singnet.com.sg> fs.c patch checks for uid matching
	    "owner" in fstab_user_permission().
	  o Tomas Ogren <stric--at--cs.umu.se> Solaris disk.c patch avoids adding
	    not found disks to the disk list.

1.2.3 Tue Oct 23, 2001
----------------------
	* Voltage monitor: handles reference voltages for negative voltages for
	  chips that need it (lm80); better factors/offsets initial values.
	  New README/gkrellm.1 section explains conversion of lm_sensors compute
	  lines to gkrellm correction factors and offsets.
	* Option to automatically track Gtk theme changes if a gkrellm theme of
	  the same name exists.
	* Minor changes: lo net interface monitoring and > 4 gig memory monitoring.
	* Some small bugfixes: apm display, inet scaling, SMP composite CPU %.

1.2.2 Wed Aug 22, 2001
----------------------
	* Hostname panel can also display system name.
	* Move krells out of the way only if data is displayed in panels,
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Close open files before launching panel commands and net timer command.
	  o Display and alert setting problems for negative voltages.
	  o Allow "owner" as well as "user" for fstab mounting.
	* Contributions:
	  o Anthony Mallet <anthony.mallet--at--useless-ficus.net> patch to fix
	    some compile issues with defining INET6 and HAVE_GETADDRINFO for
	    Solaris 7.  Also made removable disk media ioctl work for
            Solaris 7. 
	  o Przemyslaw Sulek <pbs--at--linux.net.pl> sent in a Polish translation.

1.2.1 Wed Aug 2, 2001
---------------------
	* Fixed a segfault on SMP machines.

1.2.0 Wed Aug 1, 2001
---------------------
	NOTE: Some configuration issues:
	  o Net and inet command launching will need re-entering.
	  o Inet charts can't use data saved by 1.0.x versions.
	  o Plugins that were automatically enabled by being in
	    ~/.gkrellm/plugins will now have to be enabled on the plugins
	    config page.  A consequence of this is that your existing
	    configuration setup for these plugins may be lost.

	* New chart drawing routines give many appearance options which can be
	  configured by right clicking on the charts.  Plugins which create
	  charts must make some coding changes - see the plugins changelog.
	  One of these options is a split view which uses a new theme image, so
	  split views in some themes won't look right until the themes are updated.
	* CPU charts can now show nice time, which also uses a new theme image.
	* New panel routines so panel and chart interfaces will be consistent, but
	  unlike chart plugins, meter styled plugins may upgrade gracefully
	  without a "required" recompile - see plugins changelog.
	* Added an alert interface so limits can be set for triggering warn and
	  alarm commands.  Builtin APM and sensor (temps, fan, volt) monitors
	  can have alerts set.  Alerts can use the gvoice plugin.
	* User selectable fonts.
	* User plugin placements.
	* User definable format strings for drawing chart labels.
	* Right click on most panels to open the monitor config window.
	* There is no longer compatibility with pre 0.10.0 theme formats (the
	  change was announced a year ago).
	* I can no longer provide RedHat 6.x RPMs.  The gkrellm.spec is now
	  included in the source tarball, so in case anyone wants to roll their
	  own, see the INSTALL file.
	* Contributions:
	  o Yuuki NINOMIYA <gm--at--debian.or.jp> updated his Japanese translation for
	    this release and fixed a locale bug.
	  o Cesar Perez Turrado <cesar--at--perez.turrado.com> updated his Spanish
	    translation for this release.
	  o Jason Lunz <j--at--falooley.org> patch to add multimua option to mail.c
	  o Vladimir Kondratiev <vladimir.kondratiev--at--intel.com> - spec file patch.


1.0.8-solaris Sun Apr 22, 2001
------------------------------
	* Daisuke Yabuki <dxy--at--acm.org>	contributed Solaris code so
	  monitors now have a native Solaris interface.
	  -> solaris-4: drop setgid privilege before gtk_init() (for gtk+ 1.2.9)
	  -> solaris-3: code cleanup and bug fixes.
	  -> solaris-2: kstat chain scan reduction in cpu.c and suppressed some
	     unnecessary disk accesses in disk.c
	  -> solaris-1: fixed Makefiles
	  -> solaris-0: initial Solaris patch

	Note: for version 1.0.8 _only_ there is a separate Solaris tarball since
	the only code changes are the addition of the Solaris code and so there is
	no need for all the Linux and BSD packagers to make a new package.

1.0.8 Mon Apr 16, 2001
----------------------
	* Cesar Perez Turrado <cesar--at--perez.turrado.com> sent in updated es.po
	* Bugfixes
	  o Anthony Mallet <anthony.mallet--at--useless-ficus.net> patch to fix
	    fonts with XFree86 > 4.0.2
	  o Composite disk launch commands were not saved.

1.0.7 Wed Mar 14, 2001
----------------------
	* Yuuki NINOMIYA <gm--at--debian.or.jp> sent in updated ja.po
	* Stephane Gibier <sgibier--at--mail.dotcom.fr> created the gkrellm.1 man page.
	* Patch from Laurent Caillat-Vallet <caillat--at--in2p3.fr>.  POP3/IMAP
	  connections can be on non-standard port numbers if you enter
	  server:port instead of just the server in the config.
	* Bugfixes
	  o imap checking could not handle untagged responses to LOGIN.
	  o Patch from Joshua Stein <jcs--at--rt.fm> so apm will add itself
	    under Net/Open BSD
	  o meminfo label initialization and mua_is_launched fixes.

1.0.6 Mon Jan 29, 2001
----------------------
	* Big patch from Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--FreeBSD.org> for several major BSD
	  improvements which significantly reduces cpu usage. Changes to cpu.c,
	  inet.c, main.c, meminfo.c, net.c, proc.c., uptime.c.  In net.c, he
	  merged Free/Net/Open BSD code into one read_bsd_net_data().
	  Anthony Mallet <anthony.mallet--at--useless-ficus.net> added some
	  adjustments to Hajimu's patch to remove the few remaining Net/Open
	  BSD specific differences from read_bsd_net_data().
	* inet charts can now monitor a range of port numbers as well as the
	  previous only one or two ports per plot color.  Click the new inet
	  panel button to get a list of current TCP connections being monitored.
	  Hajimu patched the new connection lookup code to use better networking
	  code and IPv6 support.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Search /usr/lib/gkrellm/plugins and /usr/local/lib/gkrellm/plugins
	    to comply with FHS.
	  o Make sure GKRELLM_DATA_DIR is created.

1.0.5 Mon Jan 22, 2001
----------------------
	* All builtins can now be disabled.
	* Kevin Ford <klford--at--uitsg.com> improved the src.rpm package .spec file.
	* MH mail checking optionally checks .mh_sequences for unseen mail.
	* Bugfixes/cleanups:
	  o apm decal drawing.
	  o All builtins now correctly use top/bottom margins.

1.0.4 Mon Jan 15, 2001
----------------------
	* Patch from Masaharu FUJITA <fujita--at--hpc.cs.ehime-u.ac.jp>  The new mail
	  krell animation for BSD is now a Daemon.
	* Namespace cleanup and removed gkrellm_private_proto.h from the install
	  and the #include by gkrellm.h.  Plugin coders should look at
	  Changelog-plugins.html.
	* Added some hooks so I could write the gkrellm-gnome plugin. With the
	  plugin, GKrellM gets Gnome session management and can set some window
	  options (ontop, sticky, skip winlist, skip focus, don't put on taskbar).
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Sensor bugs: Bad temperature updating for comma based numeric locales.
	    Problem reading negative volt factors from the config.

1.0.3 Sun Jan 7, 2001
---------------------
	* Theme and plugin changes in their respective changelogs.
	* Added --config suffix option so multiple gkrellms may be run with
	  different configurations for each.  This will override usage of any
	  host config files previously setup with --force-host-config.
	* GKrellM can reload a theme from ~/.gkrellm/gkrellm_theme.cfg when the
	  "_GKRELLM_READ_THEME" client message is sent.
	* Removed on_top option from the config and contorted startup on top
	  code from main.c.  Window managers should handle this function, but
	  you can still get GKrellM to try to set the hint by: gkrellm --on-top.
	  This will not work with all window managers - so don't use it.  Learn
	  how to tell your window manager to do this function.
	* Patches from Hajimu UMEMOTO: 1) reduce FreeBSD meminfo polling to reduce
	  cpu usage. 2) drop setuid/setgid privileges before initializing GTK+ to
	  avoid security hole.
	* Gernot Poetsch <gernot--at--mayn.de> contributed a German de.po translation.
	* Changed maildir code to not parse filenames as suggested by maildir(5):
	  Other than skipping files starting with '.', readers should not attempt
	  to parse filenames.
	* Patch from Farooq Mela <f_mela--at--yahoo.com>  Added __OpenBSD__ defines
	  so an OpenBSD native version can be compiled which it turns out is able
	  to use the existing NetBSD and in one case FreeBSD code.
	* Patch from Adam Sampson <ats1--at--ukc.ac.uk> Added MH mail check routine.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o -geometry placement was wrong for negative screen references (-x-y).
	  o Various voltage monitor stuff: negative voltage displays were at best
	    hosed, correction values did not allow enough precision, and if space
	    allows, temperature precision is now .1 degree.

1.0.2 Tue Nov 14, 2000
----------------------
	* Cesar Perez Turrado <cpt2--at--geocities.com> contributed a Spanish
	  es.po translation.
	* Added reading fan and voltage data to sensor module for Linux and
	  Hajimu added it for FreeBSD.  Now fan RPMs can be displayed on
	  the CPU and Proc panels, and there is a separate voltage monitor.
	  Themers without motherboard sensors should run "gkrellm -demo" to see it.
	* Cleaned up mail code and fixed some small bugs.
	* Patch from Matt McClure <mlm--at--aya.yale.edu> to add tooltip reporting
	  of the new mail counts for mailboxes checked via the Mail fetch/check
	  program.
	* Hajimu UMEMOTO sent in patches to use gdk_fontset_load() for the config
	  info windows.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Keyboard shortcut theme cycling bugs: theme config sometimes not
	    marked to save, gkrellm -t bad news.

1.0.1 Thu Oct 19, 2000
----------------------
	* Applied some diffs that Pascal Bleser made for his SuSE package so
	  the Makefile can use gnome-config for libgtop compiles and the spec
	  file can specify alternate system plugin and theme directories.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o The new fstab mounting check failed to consider that root does not
	    need "user" fstab permission.
	  o gtk_set_locale() should be called _before_ gtk_init().
	  o Fixed conditions for which MUA button should be sensitive since it is
	    also optionally used for stopping the animations and resetting counts.

1.0.0 Fri Oct 13, 2000
----------------------
	* Anthony Mallet <anthony.mallet--at--useless-ficus.net> contributed
	  NetBSD code so monitors now have a native NetBSD interface.
	* Nicolas Rueff <n.rueff--at--libertysurf.fr> contributed a French fr.po
	  translation.
	* Added keyboard shortcuts to cycle through all the themes and theme
	  alternatives:  'p' is previous and 'n' is next theme/alternative.
	  Keys 'u' (previous) and 'd' (next) do the same thing except they skip
	  cycling through any theme alternatives.
	* Custom Default theme images for the PMU plugin.
	* Mail sound command issued at first new mail count increase of a remote
	  check instead of waiting until last thread is done.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o smbfs added to remote fs types so it will be checked at the
	    remote interval.  And Linux /proc/mounts reports "." for the mounted
	    on directory for smbs (don't know why), so added a fallback to using
	    getmntent() when "." directories are detected.
	  o IMAP/POP3 mail checking could get confused if complete lines are not
	    received per read from a mail server, so changed raw reads to
	    a line reading routine.
	  o Theme config changes were not written at exit if theme was changed.
	  o If fstab mounting was enabled, FS monitor did not allow turning off
	    mount button if "user" option was later removed from fstab.
	  o The MUA launch button was not desensitized if there is no MUA command.
	  o Could not disable composite disk chart if no disks found (diskless WS).
	  o The plugins glist got out of sync if a plugin object file could
	    not load.

0.10.5 Sun Aug 6, 2000
----------------------
	* Patch from Jonas Linde <jonas--at--init.se>:
	  Changed set_on_top() to help GKrellM honor layer settings that
	  the window manager may specify.
	* Added some functions for plugins - see the plugins changelog.
	* Removed "Draw extra info on charts at startup" option.  All charts (and
	  File System / meminfo capacity displays) now have state in the
	  user_config file.
	* Added enable_nls script that simply changes Makefile link to
	  Makefile.top_enable_nls which compiles with i18n enabled by default.
	* Tweaked Yuuki's timer button patch so the seconds are drawn in a
	  separate text decal so style (font size / color) can match clock.
	* Patches from Yuuki NINOMIYA <gm--at--debian.or.jp>:
	  o Added seconds to the timer button online time.
	  o Replaced my erroneous use of gdk_fontset_load().
	  o Added ja.po translation which has translation contributions from
	    Yuuki and Takeshi Aihana <aihana--at--muc.biglobe.ne.jp>
	* Changed read_linux_proc() and Hajimu did same for read_freebsd_proc()
	  to stat() the utmp file and read it only if modified so disk hits
	  can be minimized.
	* Hajimu UMEMOTO patch to apm.c so operator group not needed for /dev/apm
	* Bugfixes:
	  o For locales with commas for decimal points, sscanf() in
	    read_linux_proc() could not read load average from /proc/loadavg.

0.10.4 Tue Jul 11, 2000
-----------------------
	* More Bugfixes:
	  o The threading code added in 0.10.3 created joinable instead of
	    detached threads and this caused a memory leak for each threaded check.
	  o Theme related buglets in gkrellm_make_overlay_button & draw_inet_chart.

0.10.3 Sun Jul 9, 2000
----------------------
	* Added a swap pages in/out chart to the memory monitor.
	* Restructured the mail check loop to turn the fetch check into an
	  internal mailbox type and to use threads for this patch:
	* Patch from Michael Bell <mikeb--at--map.com>:
	  He added routines for builtin POP3 and IMAP mailbox checking and
	  added reporting of them to the tooltip popup.  And added mail counts to
	  the tooltip.
	  Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> added IPv6 awareness to these routines.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o Fixed sensor temperature reporting to handle negative temps, for cryo
	    cooling mad scientists,
	  o Enabling composite Disk in kernel 2.4 did not stick.
	  o Check for duplicate plugins/themes in /usr/local/share & /usr/share
	  o Config ctree got out of sync with multiple plugin enables/disables.

0.10.2 Mon Jul 3, 2000
----------------------
	* I have two reports of BadDrawables on RedHat 6.2 systems in the root
	  pixmap transparency code.  Don't know why this is, but all this release
	  does is add a -nt option to disable getting the root pixmap so
	  people with this problem can get running.

0.10.1 Thu Jun 29, 2000
-----------------------
	* Added gravity to plugin placement so multiple plugins requesting
	  placement at the same location can have more placement control.
	* Bugfixes:
	  o hostname visiblity did not stick.
	  o `libgtop-config --libs` for libgtop-1.1.2.1-solaris at least does not
	    provide -lXau for some reason, so added it to Makefile.
	  o fs/mem/swap format strings yielding string widths less than 1/3 decal
	    width caused fp exception.

0.10.0 Wed Jun 21, 2000
-----------------------
	* Scrolling FS and Mem/Swap panel text can be dragged (borrowed the nice
	  idea from GKrellMMS).  $l added to format string set.
	* FS update intervals can be user set and nfs mount update intervals
	  can be set independently.
	* Some had crashes when initially bringing up the config window - fixed.
	* Added chart transparency in alternatives 2 and 3 to the default theme.
	* Themes can have transparent panels or charts.  I don't do an X event
	  loop and don't know how in Gtk to solicite PropertyNotify for the root
	  window, so there is currently no transparency auto updating when the
	  background is changed - it takes a click in GKrellM's top frame.
	* Disk charts can handle new Linux 2.4 format and names will be device
	  names instead of DiskA - DiskD.  The composite Disk chart is no longer
	  overloaded onto DiskA.  But I don't know what the status of IDE1 - IDE3
	  reporting is, so hdc-hdh may still not show up.
	  Hajimu patched the FreeBSD code to use the new disk naming structure,
	  and for FreeBSD 3.x or later, 'da0', 'wd1', etc style names show up.
	* Added default theme customizations for GKrellMMS and Volume plugins.
	* Theme code revised to enable plugins to have monitor specific theme
	  images and gkrellmrc Style settings just like the builtins.
	  Side effects of this are:
	  1) Data structures for image handling changed, so plugins which
	  directly access the GK struct for images (against policy) may break.
	  2) A new and clearly final theme organization has evolved :),
	  but at least all old 0.9.x themes are still handled so there
	  should be a quiet and painless transition to the new format over time.
	* Added a search for themes in /usr/local/share/gkrellm/themes and a
	  search for plugins in /usr/local/share/gkrellm/plugins.
	* No longer need to recycle config window for Info/Help font change.
	* Patch from William Carrel <william.a--at--carrel.org> and
	  Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume--at--mahoroba.org> to cleanup FreeBSD swap code.

0.9.10 Wed May 24, 2000
	* A few small bugfixes:  Mail animation never turned off if mail fetch
	  program is check only and continuous animations are enabled.  Sensor
	  temperature display disappeared for some.  Hajimu had a patch for
	  swap usage displays on FreeBSD 4.0 or later.

0.9.9 Wed May 17, 2000
	* Development kernels 2.3.99-pre8 and after are changing the format of
	  /proc/stat.  To get CPU charts back, select "composite cpu" in the
	  config.  Disk reporting formats are changing and currently will not
	  not show hdc - hdh, I assume future patches will address this.
	  In the meantime, added primitive support for Disk charts under pre8,
	  but only one Disk chart is available which combines all reported data.
	* Added nicer formatting to the Info pages and option to select font size.
	* Mem and Swap meters can scroll capacity values like the fs monitors,
	  and each of these uses a format string for custom scrolling displays.
	* Changed fs monitor button behavior: Btn1 (left) now toggles secondary
	  fs monitor visibility and Btn2 or Btn3 toggles the capacity display.
	  This is to make overall button behavior more consistent.
	* Moved all source to "src" subdir.  Better organization for distributions
	  that might want to overlay an i18n package.
	* Applied the ENABLE_NLS and string internationalization code modifications
	  from Takeshi Aihana <takeshi--at--turbolinux.co.jp>.
	* Put Disk command launcher config in a scrolled and now launch entries
	  are shown only for enabled disks.  This avoids the enlarged config
	  window in case anybody uses my kernel patches to extend kernel disk
	  reporting to 8 disks (for kernel 2.2.x).
	* Added a "comment" entry for each command launch entry so the tooltip
	  text may be set independent of the command.  Killed global tooltip
	  enable because not needed.
	* Patch from Stefan Schlott <stefan.schlott--at--student.uni-ulm.de>:
	  Added option: If there is new mail, the names of the mailboxes
	  containing new mail can be displayed in a tooltip.
	* Tuneups: don't allow moving if withdrawn.  -wm option no longer has
	  themed frames inside of window manager frames, now only the
	  window manager frames (so -wm behaves as -wm -wm did).  A change in how
	  I respond to window size configure events to try to stop the growing
	  window problem when KDE sends incorrect sizes in the configure event.

0.9.8 Mon Apr 10, 2000
	* Changed config window to use a ctree listing of monitors to select
	  configuration notebook pages.
	* Put in a default gray frame for command launch overlay buttons because
	  it appears most theme authors are not making the custom images for this.
	* Fixed bug where buttons were not destroyed in gkrellm_destroy_panel().
	* make install now installs the header files in /usr/include or
	  /usr/local/include so users who compile plugins will not be required
	  to install under the gkrellm source tree or to edit files to set the
	  gkrellm.h location.
	* Changed -wm code window policy because -wm did not work under some
	  window managers.  Now gkrellm -wm -wm inhibits themed frames.
	* FreeBSD patch from Hajimu UMEMOTO to use getloadavg() instead of
	  accessing kmem.

0.9.7 Thu Mar 23, 2000
	* Added -m2 option so 2 button mice can side frame shut with left button.
	  Also, middle and right buttons now open/shut secondary FS monitors,
	  toggle the inet charts, and toggle tha apm display.
	* Patch from Jason Kasper <j_dot_kasper--at--usa.net>: Added option to run
	  in withdrawn mode for the Blackbox slit.
	* Theme alternatives: themes can have multiple alternate image sets
	  and gkrellmrc files selectable in the Themes tab.
	  2 alt font overrides are selectable (for high res displays on small
	  screens where default theme fonts may be too small).
	* Plugins are searched for in /usr/share/gkrellm/plugins.  These
	  system wide plugins must be enabled in a "Plugin Enables" config
	  window before they will be activated.  Plugins can be placed after
	  builtins (previously only placing before was possible).
	* Hmmm, animations for maildir new messages were never turned on - fixed.
	* Patch from Stefan Schlott <stefan.schlott--at--student.uni-ulm.de>:
	  Adds a check to avoid double counting old mail with status lines
	  from Netscape and standard "Status" mail readers.  Also adds a check
	  to avoid counting mime attachments as messages, see is_multipart_mail()
	* Secondary FS monitors can optionally remain shown if mounted when
	  the secondary group is hidden.  Now the secondary group can be viewed
	  as a drawer that FS monitors can be taken out of when mounted.
	* FS mount commands can be customized so mounts can be made of file
	  systems not in /etc/fstab.  Using this requires that GKrellM be
	  run as root or that the user has sudo mount priviledges.
	* Changed the FS capacity display from toggling to scrolling and added
	  option to display in binary units (MiB GiB) instead of default SI norm.
	* Patch from Tom Gilbert <gilbertt--at--btinternet.com> allows window
	  managers to differentiate options dialog from GKrellM itself.

0.9.6 Fri Mar 10, 2000
	* Transparency mask now handled at configure_notify events instead of
	  after pack_side_frames() because gdk_window_shape_combine_mask() was
	  not working for some people.
	* fixed fetchmail -c reading bug when output was: x messages (y seen) ...
	  Added mailbox status detecting for Netscape mailboxes (X-Mozilla-Status)
	* Changed timer command launch logic because some people are getting
	  stale /var/run/ppp0.pid files left after pppd quits.
	* Changed some plugin interface function names and one prototype to make
	  function calling style more consistent.
	* Patch from Kazuhisa TAKEI <takei--at--vinelinux.org>: added a middle mouse
	  button toggle to show percentage time left on apm panel.
	* For Linux, uptime monitor now always reads /proc/uptime instead of
	  calculating an uptime (which had a fuzzy meaning for laptops that sleep).

0.9.5 Fri Mar 3, 2000
	* Net charts can have a label so you can title them with info about who
	  they are connected to.
	* Applied FreeBSD patch from Hajimu UMEMOTO to reduce potential
	  security risks.
	* Tooltips can be enabled for monitors that have a launch command set.
	* Bug fixes: changed foreground/background pixel setting for depth 1 GCs
	  to guarantee foreground pixel is 1.
	* Fix from Hideaki YOSHIFUJI <yoshfuji--at--ecei.tohoku.ac.jp> conditionally
	  defines INET6 so Linux systems using glibc 2.0 can compile inet.c

0.9.4 Mon Feb 28, 2000
    * FreeBSD code contributed by Hajimu UMEMOTO ume--at--mahoroba.org
      All monitors now have a FreeBSD interface.  He also added IPv6 support
      to the internet monitors for both FreeBSD and Linux.
    * #ifdef'ed out libgtop if compiling under Linux and removed the Linux
      dependency on libgtop to fix RPM dependency and compile problems some
      were having.  Other systems can still compile a libgtop version.
    * Bugs fixed: nice cpu time wasn't added to the total cpu time. If Proc
	  monitor was disabled, restarting and writing config caused a segfault.

0.9.3 Wed Feb 24, 2000
	* Patch from Darko Koruga <darko.koruga--at--hermes.si> Feb 24, 2000
	  Continuous mail animation option as long as there is new mail.
	* Added up/down clist moving for fs entry editing.
	* Fixed /etc/fstab reading of options if it is last token on line.
0.9.2 Wed Feb 23, 2000
	* Fixed net packet reporting bug in 2.0 kernels.  Enforced sensors.c
	  read_temperature() reads to no more than once per 4 seconds.
0.9.1 Wed Feb 23, 2000
	* Fixed segfault if there are empty lines in /etc/fstab
0.9.0 Tue Feb 22, 2000
	* If hostname specific config files are used, put the hostname in the
	  X title so the window manager can distinguish between remote GKrellMs.
	* Added /usr/share/gkrellm/themes to theme search path.
	* Added command launching capability to most monitors.
	* Made adding of nice to user CPU usage an option.
	* Mail check only mode tries to read the nmh program flist output
	  for checking MH mail folders and tries to handle yet another
	  fetchmail output variation.  Trapped out MAILER DAEMON internal data
	  messages.
	* Fixed remember position at exit bogus coordinates bug.
	* Added decal buttons and frame buttons - replaced timer gtk button
	  with a decal button.  Turned FS mount decals into decal buttons.
	* Side frame button 2 instead of button 1 now closes GKrellM.
	* Changes affecting plugins, create_plugin() coding style changes.
	  Some function prototype changes and some function replacement.
	* Timer button combo box to allow timer button links to ppp1, ippp0, ...
	  Changed uptime timer to use /var/run/pppX.pid for ppp types.
	* Set up allocation/free checks for images, pixmaps, styles, etc, so
	  themes and sizes can be changed without restarting.  Added keyboard
	  shortcuts to aid themers: F5 reload current theme, F6, F7 debugging.
	* Theme image naming and gkrellmrc structure redefined to purge coding
	  problems I was having with backward compatibility.  Cleaned up
	  styles.
	* All monitors restructured to modularize the data collection parts.
	  Put in automatic switchover from /proc to glibtop if /proc files
	  do not exist (for monitors glibtop can service).  If no /proc data and
	  no glibtop calls, monitors do not install themselves.
	* Added apm enable for laptops with problems reading /proc/apm
	* -demo mode so themers can see all monitors.

0.8.1 Thu Jan 20, 2000
	* Fixed bug I introduced into host config code from Dan Mass - sorry.
	* Added theme images for slider support.
	* Added several gkrellm_xxx() interface functions for plugins.
	  Added plugins/plugin_example/plugin_example.c as advanced plugin demo.
	* Major revision of the Themes document for theme image renaming.
	  Final non-backwards compatible change planned for 0.8.2

0.8.0 Fri Jan 14, 2000
	* Plugin cabability added.  Restructured builtin monitor interfaces to
	  use same interface as plugins - more modular and trivial to convert
	  a plugin to a builtin.
	  Coded basic template plugin module.
	  Adopted gkrellm_ prefix for public functions intended to be
	  useable by plugins.
	* FS mount/umount error reporting.
	* Disk monitor extended to handle DiskA - DiskD and composite Disk.
	* Changed theme subdir locations from ~/.gkrellm to ~/.gkrellm/themes,
	  added upgrade_warn_message() for this. Changed +data dir to data.
	* Frame transparency and other new theme features - see the Themes file.
    * Patch from Dan Maas <dmaas--at--dcine.com> Dec 22, 1999
	  Added support for host-specific configs and themes
	  This is for people with > 1 computer but a shared home directory.
	  Accept user_config and gkrellm_theme.cfg with a dash and then
	  the hostnames appended... If I have two computers named abe and bill,
	  I use user_config-abe, user_config-bill, gkrellm_theme.cfg-abe and
	  gkrellm_theme.cfg-bill. They will be managed separately by gkrellm,
	  so you can have different settings for each machine.
	* Patch from Patrick Morris <pmorris--at--starnixsolutions.com> Dec 15, 1999
	  check_maildir() accepts _name as messages.
 
0.7.5 Wed Dec 5, 1999
	* Bugfix: The motherboard temperature display went away in 0.7.4 - fixed.
	* Bugfix: the new "Always on top" option did not work if gkrellm was
	  started before a window manager (in .xinitrc or .xsession)

0.7.4 Wed Dec 1, 1999
	* Restructured chart drawing code to minimize X (network) traffic.
	* Added some modes: save_position at exit, always on top, mail
	  animation modes.
	* Krell/LED update rate configurable.
	* Charts can have 1-5 fixed grids instead of auto scaling.
	* Added documentation to the Info tabs.
	* Detect when GKrellM is resting on screen bottom or right edge and
	  make it stick there when resizing to smaller size.
	* Bug fixes.

0.7.3 Fri Nov 5, 1999
	* Minor changes mainly as final tune up before Debian potato freeze.
	* Cleaned up mailcheck animation conditions, added fetch no download
	  mode and inhibit mailcheck while MUA launched mode.
	* Check for root uid in FS mountable check.
	* Modem lock file link in ~/.gkrellm check added.

0.7.2 Sun Oct 31, 1999
	* Put number of procs extra on Proc chart above users extra.
	* Mailcheck checks file sizes + mtime (mutt, etc restore mtimes)
	* Added msg_count_mode, mail_check_timeout.
	* Put current_processes on Proc chart.
	* Added check_maildir() routine contributed by Patrick Crosby <xb--at--dotfiles.com>

0.7.1 Wed Oct 27, 1999
	* Mailbox check monitor + animations + remote mail fetch + sound.
	# Historical inet data is saved at exit and loaded at startup.
	* Added seconds display to clock.
	* User interface cleanup for fs, inet - clists show all monitors.
	* Changed config model from "OK Apply Cancel" to "OK Apply Close"
	* Restart uses execvp() instead of system().
	* Changed ppp timer/button to more general timer/button.  PPP0 panel may
	  be decoupled from timer/button.

0.7.0 Wed Oct 5
	* File system monitor.  Mount/umount capability.
	* Internet monitor.  Port connections and minute/hour port hit charts.
	* APM laptop battery monitor.
	* Sensors monitor for CPU/motherboard temperatures if lm_sensors installed
	* Modified default bg_chart and added data_in/out images to default theme.
	* Added data_in, data_out images for 3D/textured data plotting.
	* Option to start up with chart extra info draws enabled.

0.6.8
	* Long or short hostnames
	* Net interfaces can be hidden - if seldom used or unwanted.
	* For themers: quoted strings, label position as percent of chart width,
	  LED & PPP button size and position scaling.

0.6.7 Sun Sep 4
	* More gtk_widget_realize fixes to get rid of Gtk 1.2.1 (RedHat 6.0) 
	  Gdk-CRITICAL messages (and some people got segfaults).
	* Themes tab in configuration popup.
	* Some code cleanup.
	* Added -wm option to allow window managers to decorate.  Might
	  help KDE etc, people.

0.6.6 Mon Aug 30
	* Cleaned up some code.  Some bugfixes.
	* Finally may have done the realize/show dance properly.  Seems to work
	  fine with Gtk 1.2.3 and 1.2.4

0.6.5 Thu Aug 26 late night.
	* Clock/calendar
	* Extra detail info drawn on charts.

0.6.4 Thu Aug 26 morning.
	* Added extra hide/show for gtk+1.2.4 startup autoshrink problem.
	* Now allow dual units on net traffic.  Packets used if bytes are zero.
